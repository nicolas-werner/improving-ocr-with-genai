    "text": "distinct with spots, both matured in cruelty. The river called Cygnus by name because it is the most rapid of all rivers. This magnitude of humanity produces. The tiger returns to its empty den with the captured one: it insists on reclaiming its leftovers. And such who are left vacant, they, in order, lay themselves down: nor do any of them manage to evade. They believe that they were led by deception in such a way. When they conspire against him, presenting a diverse threat. He is deceived by the image it plays with and justly punished by it. Again, seeking an opportunity, he holds off the beast which was hewn down. Again far and wide they recognize the properties of horses, pouring back any escape launch. That ruinous frenzy covers the highest point, is brought to the senses by force. He grows stubborn as he retreats back. Nor is it so diligent as to cheat just once. Perhaps to what its hidden image. and if it really hunts the beast once more. with sudden destruction. and finally roamed around\r\nPardus\r\nIt is conceived and\r\ngenerated from\r\nboth lion and leopard. And the name of threefold descent is affixed. Thus it is established in natural history. The lion breeds a \r\ngolden one part\r\nLeopard could be conceived and grown together with generational corruptions."
