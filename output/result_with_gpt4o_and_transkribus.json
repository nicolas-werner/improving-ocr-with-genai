    "text": "...distinguished by spots. Remarkable for its strength and speed, from which the river Tigris is named, because it is the swiftest of all rivers. It is more often born from humans. When the tiger finds the den empty of its stolen cub, it immediately follows the tracks of the thief. But although the thief is carried on a swift horse, seeing himself surpassed in speed by the beast, and finding no means of escape, he devises a trick of this kind. When he sees himself about to be caught, he throws a glass sphere. And the tiger, deceived by the image of itself, thinks it is its cub. It withdraws its attack, gathering itself in desire. Again, seeing the recent image, it throws itself with all its strength to capture the rider, and driven by the spur of anger, it swiftly pursues the fleeing one. But the rider, by throwing the sphere, delays the pursuer, yet the memory of the mother's trick does not exclude the fraud. It turns the image, and because the capture remains with it. Thus, deceived by its own affection, it loses both its revenge and its offspring. About the leopard. The leopard is\nvaried in birth and\nvery swift, and\nquick to blood. It leaps\nlike a turtle. The lion\nand leopard breed\na hybrid offspring, and a third origin is produced.\nAs is more fully said in natural history. The lion and leopard mate, or the lioness gives birth, and from both degenerate offspring are born."
